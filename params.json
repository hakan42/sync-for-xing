One of them is that\r\nthe client offers no way to automatically sync contact data, which by now is the required minimum\r\nfunctionality of most social networking applications.\r\n\r\nThe client I used until some time ago\r\n[Xing Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danielweisser.android.xingsync)\r\nwritten by [Daniel Weisser](http://www.danielweisser.de/blog/),\r\nstopped working with the transition to Ice Cream Sandwich.\r\n\r\nSo, to scratch that specific itch, and to teach myself about Android programming, OAuth and a\r\nfew other topics, I started building this client.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\n[![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/526a4290632bac312a0002ab/badge.png)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/526a4290632bac312a0002ab)\r\n\r\n\r\nMaven Site(s)\r\n-------------\r\nThe site documentation is autogenerated and available for perusal.\r\n* [SNAPSHOT](http://xing-sync.gurkensalat.com/site/0.5.0-SNAPSHOT/)\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------\r\nPlease see our [Contibution Documents](https://github.com/hakan42/xing-sync/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nxing-sync is licenced under the [Apache 2.0 Licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
