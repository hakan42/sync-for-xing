One of them is that\r\nthe client offers no way to automatically sync contact data, which by now is the required minimum\r\nfunctionality of most social networking applications.\r\n\r\nThe client I used until some time ago\r\n[Xing Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danielweisser.android.xingsync)\r\nwritten by [Daniel Weisser](http://www.danielweisser.de/blog/),\r\nstopped working with the transition to Ice Cream Sandwich.\r\n\r\nSo, to scratch that specific itch, and to teach myself about Android programming, OAuth and a\r\nfew other topics, I started building this client.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------\r\nPlease see our [Contibution Documents](https://github.com/hakan42/xing-sync/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nxing-sync is licenced under the [Apache 2.0 Licence](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n"}
