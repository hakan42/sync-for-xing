Automated Android Contact Synchronization with XING

Why?
------
I am not happy with the official [XING](http://www.xing.de) client in many ways. One of them is that
the client offers no way to automatically sync contact data, which by now is the required minimum
functionality of most social networking applications.

The client I used until some time ago
[Xing Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danielweisser.android.xingsync)
written by [Daniel Weisser](http://www.danielweisser.de/blog/),
stopped working with the transition to Ice Cream Sandwich.

So, to scratch that specific itch, and to teach myself about Android programming, OAuth and a
few other topics, I started building this client.
